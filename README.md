Project Description

1. Reason for making this project

   For a long time, I have longed and looked forward to Christmas. Before, 
   Christmas was not a traditional festival in China, so every December, the festive atmosphere was not so strong and the experience was not very good. After coming    to the UK, I experienced some festivals and arranged the Christmas tree by myself. I fully realized the special features of this festival. Based on this, I want    to make a Christmas tree project.

2. Create objects and scenes

   Idea Realization: create elements -> use array variables 
   
   Create a 2D scene, function and object in the project, and then need to color the object through GLSL ES; then set the color of the element (four colors), the      rotation speed, swirls, width and height. It can control the rotation speed of objects in the scene and adjust it to the most comfortable-looking state. Not only    that, but you can also change the color and spacing of these elements to achieve the desired effect.
  
   Request Animation Frame
   
   The object moves at a constant speed based on a vertex. In the vortex node, using the calculation method of pi, each element expands into motion.
   The effect presented in the animation is a rotating Christmas tree that mimics the appearance of a Christmas tree in a street window in reality. Visually            speaking, it is smoother and gives a more realistic look.

3. Future research

   In the future, I want to achieve richer interactive effects and transfer more data to objects. In this project, through the creation of more scenes and elements    and the integration of audio visualization, more vivid effects and interesting interactions can be achieved. In the future course study, will be more in-depth      exploration.
